Machine Learning for the preventive detection of glaucoma
</h1>

## Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and in Colombia, it remains largely underdiagnosed due to limited access to specialized eye care. This project aims to implement an accessible, technology-driven early detection system to identify individuals at risk and provide timely interventions, ultimately reducing preventable blindness.
